A lightweight [Three.js](https://threejs.org/) demo that replays drift telemetry data.  
Built as a proof-of-concept to visualize **Race Data Labs telemetry** in a browser.

- 📊 **Telemetry HUD** – live speed, drift angle, and acceleration readouts  
- ⏯ **Playback Controls** – play, pause, scrub timeline, and change playback speed  
- 🎥 **Camera Modes** – orbit camera or top-down “map” view  
- 🗺 **Track Path** – auto-generated from telemetry heading + speed

## 🛠 Tech Stack
- **Three.js** (WebGL rendering)  
- **JavaScript (ES Modules)**
